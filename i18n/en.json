  "baptism.section1.title": "What is baptism?",
  "baptism.section1.content": "Baptism is a sacred ordinance that marks the beginning of your journey as a disciple of Jesus Christ. It is a covenant you make with God, promising to take upon yourself the name of Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. In return, God promises the forgiveness of your sins and the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.\n\nBaptism is performed by complete immersion in water, symbolizing the death of the natural man and rebirth as a new creature in Christ. It is the first step on the path to eternal life.",
  "baptism.section2.title": "What happens on your baptism day (step by step)",
  "baptism.section2.content": "1. You will arrive at the baptism location (may be a baptismal font in the chapel or a place with sufficient water).\n\n2. You will change into special white clothing for baptism.\n\n3. A priesthood holder will baptize you by complete immersion, saying: \"[Your name], having been commissioned by Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\n\n4. After baptism, you will change and return for confirmation.\n\n5. You will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.\n\n6. There will be testimonies and words of welcome from Church members.\n\n7. You will receive a certificate of baptism and confirmation.",
  "baptism.section3.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "baptism.section3.content": "This section contains answers to common questions about baptism. You can expand each question to see the answer.",
  "baptism.section4.title": "The baptismal interview",
  "baptism.section4.content": "The baptismal interview is a reverent conversation with an authorized Church leader. Its purpose is to confirm that:\n\n• You understand the basic principles of the gospel.\n• You have faith in Jesus Christ and have repented.\n• You are prepared to make and keep sacred covenants.\n• You understand the importance of baptism and confirmation.\n\nIt is not a test to fail, but an opportunity to strengthen your faith and ensure you are ready for this important step. The leader will ask you questions about your testimony, your understanding of the gospel, and your commitment to follow Christ.",
  "baptism.section5.title": "After baptism",
  "baptism.section5.content": "After your baptism, you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. This gift allows you to have the constant companionship of the Spirit if you remain worthy.\n\nEach week you will participate in the sacrament (Holy Communion) to renew your baptismal covenants and receive continuous forgiveness.\n\nYour learning journey continues. You will continue studying the Scriptures, attending Church, serving others, and growing in your faith. Baptism is not the end, but the beginning of a life of discipleship and spiritual growth.\n\nOver time, you will be able to participate in additional temple ordinances, which will prepare you for eternal life with your family.",
  "baptism.faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "baptism.faq1.q": "What if I'm afraid of water?",
  "baptism.faq1.a": "If you're afraid of water, talk to the missionaries and Church leaders. They can make special arrangements so you feel comfortable. Baptism is by immersion, but it can always be adapted for people with special needs.",
  "baptism.faq2.q": "What happens if I make mistakes after being baptized?",
  "baptism.faq2.a": "Making mistakes is part of being human. The gospel teaches us about repentance, which is the process of turning away from sin and turning toward Christ. Through sincere repentance and participation in the sacrament, we can be forgiven and continue to grow.",
  "baptism.faq3.q": "Can I invite my family and friends?",
  "baptism.faq3.a": "Absolutely! Your baptism is a special occasion and it's wonderful to share it with the people you love. Invite your family, friends, and anyone who wants to be with you on this important moment.",
  "baptism.faq4.q": "Do I need to know everything about the gospel before being baptized?",
  "baptism.faq4.a": "You don't need to know everything. What's important is to have faith in Jesus Christ, repent of your sins, and be willing to make covenants with God. Learning continues throughout life. Baptism is the beginning, not the end of your spiritual education.",
  "baptism.faq5.q": "What clothes should I wear?",
  "baptism.faq5.a": "The Church provides special white clothing for baptism. You only need to bring white underwear and a towel. After baptism, you will change into your normal clothes for confirmation.",
  "baptism.faq6.q": "How long does the ceremony last?",
  "baptism.faq6.a": "The complete ceremony, including baptism, confirmation, testimonies, and words of welcome, generally lasts between 30 and 60 minutes. It is a special and meaningful moment.",
