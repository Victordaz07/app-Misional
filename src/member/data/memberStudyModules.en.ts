### What does it really mean to have faith in Christ as a member?

Faith in Jesus Christ is more than accepting that He is the Son of God. It is trusting His character so deeply that we are willing to risk comfort, prestige, and time to follow Him. A member with living faith:

- Assumes that the Lord is already preparing people around them.
- Prays with the expectation of receiving impressions about whom to serve, invite, or comfort.
- Sees the commandments as opportunities to show love, not as a cold checklist.

Preach My Gospel teaches that faith leads to action and repentance. For a ward member, that action includes studying the gospel with the intent to share, asking “Who needs an invitation, a message, or a smile today?”, and believing that even if they feel awkward, the Spirit can magnify a sincere testimony.

When a member acts this way, missionary work is no longer something “the elders do”; it becomes their own way of living discipleship.`,

### Repentance as a way of life

A member who understands the doctrine of Christ does not see repentance as punishment but as a daily privilege. Continuous repentance includes:

- Recognizing patterns of pride, spiritual laziness, or indifference.
- Honestly telling the Father where we are falling short in loving as Christ loves.
- Making concrete decisions: changing routines, asking forgiveness, making restitution, adjusting priorities.

In missionary work, a constantly repenting member is more patient with investigators and new converts, speaks of Christ from personal experience, and does not pretend to be perfect but becomes a humble witness that the Lord changes hearts. That kind of atmosphere helps the Church feel like a spiritual hospital, not a museum of “perfect” people.`,

### Enduring as a covenant community

Enduring to the end is not a solitary experience. The Lord established His Church so that we would sustain one another, care for new converts, and work with the missionaries to build the kingdom. A member who endures feeds their faith with daily scripture study and real prayer, looks for opportunities to serve quietly, and does not abandon new converts when the excitement of baptism fades.

Enduring means coming unto Christ again and again, bringing others with us. It is continuing to renew covenants even in difficult weeks and remembering that the Lord values constant, sincere effort more than instant perfection.`,

### Two forces that complement each other

Full-time missionaries have authority to teach and gather Israel. Members have daily access to neighbors, co-workers, friends, and family. When both work together:

- The Spirit is poured out in greater power.
- People feel real support, not just occasional visits.
- New converts are more likely to stay because they already have ties in the ward.

Working with missionaries includes:

- Being available to accompany them in key lessons.
- Introducing them naturally to friends and acquaintances, without pressure.
- Coordinating with the ward mission leader and bishopric so that efforts are organized and focused.

The goal is not for members to “control” missionary work or for missionaries to do everything, but to become a team where each magnifies their role before the Lord.`,

### Referrals born from prayer, not pressure

A good referral begins long before speaking with the missionaries. It starts when a member:

- Prays for specific people by name.
- Serves and listens with genuine love.
- Discerns the right moment to invite or share something spiritual.

When offering a referral:

- Briefly explain the person's context to the missionaries (family situation, previous religious experience, concerns).
- Clarify how open they are (curious, interested, in crisis, actively seeking truth).
- Offer to be present for the first visit when appropriate.

After the first lesson, the member remains crucial: a simple text message, an invitation to church, a prayer together, or a meal at home. That way, the investigator feels that they are loved by a covenant community, not just “a project” of the missionaries.`,

### More than a name on a list

A new convert arrives with excitement, questions, fears, and often family pressure. Some common mistakes in wards include:

- Leaving all responsibility on the missionaries.
- Assuming they “already know” how the Church works.
- Expecting too much, too fast, without walking beside them.

Key principles:

- Three friends in the ward: at least a leader, a teacher, and someone in a similar life situation (youth, young single adult, parents, etc.).
- Frequent but non-invasive contact: a midweek message, sitting together in sacrament meeting, including them in simple activities.
- Repeated teaching: many doctrines must be explained again, with patience and real-life examples.

When the ward adopts the new convert as part of the covenant family, the likelihood that they will endure in the gospel increases dramatically.`,

### Serving in order to belong

A new convert who only “sits and listens” will eventually feel like a spectator. Leaders can:

- Extend simple callings: greeting at the door, helping prepare the sacrament (when appropriate), supporting activities, indexing, simple music support, and more.
- Coordinate among the ward mission leader, quorum presidencies, Relief Society, and youth organizations so no one falls through the cracks.
- Avoid callings that isolate them (for example, things that constantly pull them away from the classes they most need).

Every calling should include:

- Simple training.
- Someone to walk with them at the beginning.
- Regular reassurance: “You’re doing well. Thank you for serving.”

In this way, new converts learn that in the Church they are not only fed but also trusted and needed.`,

### From baptism to the temple: one continuous path

For worthy men, understanding the Aaronic Priesthood as a preparatory priesthood is vital: ministering, blessing, learning to preside with humility. Later, the Melchizedek Priesthood expands those responsibilities with deeper spiritual blessings.

For all members, both new and long-time, the temple is the natural continuation of baptismal covenants. Helping a new convert prepare for the temple includes:

- Accompanying them in their first visit to perform baptisms for the dead.
- Explaining respectfully how sacred the temple is, without sharing details that are only taught there.
- Helping them live worthily the law of chastity, the Word of Wisdom, honest tithing, and integrity.

The goal is not to “rush them to the temple” just to add a statistic, but to help them understand that the temple is where God seals and elevates the covenants they have already started to make with Him.`,
