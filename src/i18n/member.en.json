          "summary": "Before speaking of Christ we need to live in Christ. Member missionary work doesn’t start with an invitation but with a covenant.",
          "content": "As a member of the Church, you’ve already made covenants that bind you to the Savior. Those covenants place you, by definition, inside His work. It’s not an optional assignment but a natural part of following Him. A disciple-missionary isn’t perfect or all-knowing—just someone whose faith doesn’t stay locked inside the chapel.\n\nBeing a disciple-missionary means your testimony isn’t limited to the Sunday microphone; it filters into how you work, treat your family, react when someone makes mistakes, and talk about Jesus when opportunities arise. It isn’t about preaching nonstop, but about living so the Spirit can trust you to speak when needed.\n\nPrepare spiritually with simple, steady habits: real prayer, deliberate scripture study, full participation in the sacrament, and small decisions of obedience. The more your heart and behavior align with the Savior, the more naturally you’ll participate in His gathering work."

          "content": "The doctrine of Christ isn’t just a lesson outline; it’s the roadmap to the Lord’s return. Every time you help someone exercise faith, repent, receive covenants, or remain faithful, you’re directly participating in preparing for the Second Coming.\n\nFor members, that means examining how we live the doctrine ourselves: Is our faith merely intellectual or tied to obedience? Is repentance occasional or a daily process? Do we value our baptismal covenants as a living contract with heaven? Do we seek the Holy Ghost with the same urgency we seek temporary solutions?\n\nWhen a friend sees someone truly repenting—acknowledging mistakes without excuses and changing with the Savior’s help—they’re seeing the doctrine of Christ in action. Your personal repentance and covenant loyalty are some of your most powerful witnessing tools. Missionary work isn’t just inviting others to be baptized; it’s walking with them through every stage of the doctrine of Christ."

          "content": "Many members fear talking about the gospel because they only imagine awkward scenarios—forcing topics, insisting when someone doesn’t want to listen, or seeming fanatic. The key is remembering that the gospel is shared more like a personal testimony than a debate.\n\nStart by weaving God naturally into your everyday language. Instead of saying “I was lucky,” you might say “I felt the Lord helped me with this.” When someone talks about a trial, you could share, “When I faced something similar, praying brought me peace.” You’re not delivering a sermon; you’re opening a spiritual door.\n\nLearn to ask inspired questions: “Do you believe in God?” “Have you wondered what happens after death?” “Would you like to come to an activity where we talk about these things?” Don’t respond with memorized phrases; truly listen and answer from your sincere experience. Leave room for silence—sometimes the Spirit speaks when we decide not to fill every second with words."

          "summary": "The goal isn’t to win an argument but to open a door. An inspired invitation honors agency and leaves space for yes, no, or not yet.",
          "content": "A good invitation is specific, kind, and paired with “whether you come or not, we’re still friends.” For example: “This Sunday we’re having a special meeting about Jesus Christ. I’d love for you to come. If you can’t or don’t feel ready, that’s okay—just know I’ll still be here for you.”\n\nAvoid phrases that guilt or corner someone. Don’t say, “If you cared, you’d come,” or turn the invitation into a test of loyalty. The Savior never manipulated anyone into following Him; He extended His hand and respected the choice.\n\nRemember that even a “no” can be part of the process. Sometimes people remember your invitation years later when they need the gospel. Your role is to invite with love and remain a true friend, not control the timing or the response."

        "testimonio": {
          "title": "Bearing testimony with power and simplicity",
          "summary": "A testimony isn’t a speech—it’s a spiritual act where you declare what you know and feel through the Spirit.",
          "content": "An effective testimony doesn’t need to be long or perfect. It can have three parts: what you experienced, what you felt, and what you now believe. For example: “Our family went through something hard. I prayed and studied the Book of Mormon. Not everything changed at once, but I felt peace that could only come from God. That’s why I know He listens to prayers.”\n\nAvoid language that sounds too formal or unlike how you normally speak. People sense when words are genuine or rehearsed. Talk about Jesus naturally—as a living Being who walks with you, not a distant historical figure.\n\nAsk the Spirit to help you know when to finish. Sometimes talking too long weakens what was already said with power. Learn to close simply: “That’s what I feel” or “I wanted to share that with you.” The Spirit will do the rest."

You can help in many ways: praying for them, accompanying them, introducing them to friends, offering your home as a safe teaching space, or simply encouraging them when they’re discouraged.\n\nRemember they serve under the mission president and local priesthood leaders. Avoid pushing them to break rules even if you think it’ll help. If you have suggestions, share them humbly and let them seek appropriate direction.\n\nWhen you’re in a lesson, your role isn’t to correct every word or dominate the conversation but to support spiritually—bearing testimony, sharing a brief experience, loving the friend who is learning, and showing how the gospel works in real life. Investigators remember both the doctrine and the spirit they felt as they watched how members and missionaries treat each other."

          "content": "A new member often experiences many changes quickly: new standards, responsibilities, and sometimes opposition. What they need most isn’t constant reminders of everything they lack but someone to walk beside them, answer questions without judgment, and show that the Church has room for imperfect people becoming real disciples.\n\nSit with them in meetings, explain how the sacrament works, who’s who in the ward, how to find classes, and how to use Gospel Library resources. Invite them to your home naturally—not as a “project” but as another friend of the family.\n\nSome converts see the temple as distant or intimidating. Share your preparation experience, explain that the temple is a place of peace, not human perfection, and help them take small steps: attend temple baptisms, prepare family names, and meet with leaders confidently and without fear."
